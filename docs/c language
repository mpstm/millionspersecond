variables, assignment, loops, functions

BCPL by Martin Richards 
C proceed indirectly through B written by Ken Thompson 1970 
BCPL and C are typeless
int and floating are several sizes
derived types, pointers,arrays, structures and unions
expressions by operands, any expressions
assignment, function call
control flow - 
     decision making ( if - else )
     selecting ( switch )
     loop/termination ( while , for , bottom(do) , break
     
function return 
    basic types, structures, unions, pointers, 
     
calling function recursively
local variables, automatics 
variables declared in block-structed
C is relatively low - level language
------------------
Baisc language
- standard collection of functions
- straing forward, single threaded
- ANSI C
- programmers know what they are doing
Chapter - 1
 - variable, constants, arithmetic, control flow and funtions

- variable scope

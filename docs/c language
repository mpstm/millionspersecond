control flow - 
     decision making ( if - else )
     selecting ( switch )
     loop/termination ( while , for , bottom(do) , break
     
function return 
    basic types, structures, unions, pointers, 
     
calling function recursively
local variables, automatics 
variables declared in block-structed
C is relatively low - level language
------------------
Baisc language
- standard collection of functions
- straing forward, single threaded
- ANSI C
- programmers know what they are doing
Chapter - 1
